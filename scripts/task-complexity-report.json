      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Set up TypeScript Project Structure",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the TypeScript project setup task into 4 subtasks covering: 1) Initial project creation and configuration, 2) Dependency installation and management, 3) Build process setup with webpack, and 4) Development environment configuration (linting, formatting).",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard project setup procedures but requires specific configuration for browser compatibility and multiple dependencies. The complexity is moderate as it involves several interconnected steps that form the foundation of the project."
    },

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Bookmarklet Initialization Code",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the bookmarklet initialization task into 3 subtasks covering: 1) Core self-executing function implementation, 2) Resource loading and dependency management, and 3) Error handling and user feedback mechanisms.",
      "reasoning": "Creating a bookmarklet involves browser-specific considerations and potential edge cases. The initialization code must handle multiple scenarios including preventing duplicate initialization and managing dependencies, adding moderate complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Content Extraction with Readability",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the content extraction task into 4 subtasks covering: 1) Readability library integration, 2) DOM processing and content extraction service, 3) Metadata preservation implementation, and 4) Fallback strategies for extraction failures.",
      "reasoning": "Content extraction requires handling unpredictable webpage structures and implementing fallback strategies. The integration with Readability adds complexity, and the task must account for various edge cases and extraction failures."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement HTML to Markdown Conversion with Turndown",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the HTML to Markdown conversion task into 5 subtasks covering: 1) Turndown library integration, 2) Custom rule implementation for special HTML elements, 3) Table and complex structure handling, 4) Markdown post-processing and cleanup, and 5) Edge case handling for unusual HTML structures.",
      "reasoning": "Converting HTML to well-formatted markdown is highly complex due to the variety of HTML structures that must be handled. Custom rules for special elements and proper handling of tables, code blocks, and nested structures add significant complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Design and Implement UI Overlay",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the UI overlay implementation task into 4 subtasks covering: 1) Overlay structure and styling, 2) Responsive design implementation, 3) Accessibility compliance, and 4) Event handling for user interactions.",
      "reasoning": "Creating a non-intrusive overlay requires careful DOM manipulation and CSS implementation. The need for responsiveness, accessibility compliance, and proper event handling adds significant complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Copy to Clipboard Functionality",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the clipboard functionality task into 3 subtasks covering: 1) Modern Clipboard API implementation, 2) Fallback mechanisms for older browsers, and 3) User feedback for copy operations.",
      "reasoning": "While conceptually straightforward, clipboard operations require browser compatibility considerations and fallback mechanisms. The complexity is moderate due to the need to handle permissions and provide appropriate user feedback."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Image Extraction and Carousel",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the image carousel task into 5 subtasks covering: 1) Image extraction and filtering logic, 2) Carousel component implementation, 3) Navigation and interaction controls, 4) Image download functionality, and 5) Responsive design for various screen sizes.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex DOM manipulation, image processing, and interactive UI components. The carousel must handle various image types, provide multiple interaction options, and maintain responsive behavior across devices."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Error Tracking and Analytics",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the error tracking and analytics task into 3 subtasks covering: 1) Error capture and reporting service, 2) Plausible analytics integration, and 3) Privacy-compliant data collection implementation.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing robust error tracking requires handling various error types and ensuring reports are sent reliably. The analytics integration adds complexity through the need to balance useful data collection with privacy considerations."
    },

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Add Branding and Feedback Button",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the branding and feedback task into 2 subtasks covering: 1) Branding element implementation with proper styling, and 2) Feedback button with form integration.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward UI task with minimal complexity. It involves basic DOM manipulation and styling, with simple event handling for the feedback button."
    },

      "taskTitle": "Integrate Components and Package as Bookmarklet",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration and packaging task into 5 subtasks covering: 1) Main application orchestration class, 2) Component integration and workflow implementation, 3) Code optimization for size and performance, 4) Bookmarklet generation and packaging, and 5) Cross-browser compatibility testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task represents the culmination of all previous work and requires careful integration of multiple components. The complexity is high due to the need to orchestrate all functionality, handle errors gracefully, optimize for performance, and ensure cross-browser compatibility."
